# Introducing the Tutor Trainer

Thank you for checking my project. The Tutor Trainer is a react web-app built using vite made to help prospective tutors without any tutoring experiences learn using AI. Tutoring is a skill, and having the ability to communicate your thoughts effectively is a difficult skill to master. While this app can't replace the experience gained from tutoring real students and shouldn't be used as a training program, it does help users retain skills and learn how to compress complicated ideas into words at varying levels of learning. 

## Features

- Customizable personas
  - The Tutor Trainer allows you to generate a student to tutor as students can be learning all sorts of topic at varying grade levels. This allows the user to practice tutoring anything from 1st grade grammar, to 7th grade algebra, to college-level economics. If you don't want to generate a default student, that's alright, the Tutor Trainer allows you to talk to our mascot: Tiana, a 7th grade art student.

- Chatrooms
  - You get to talk to the person you generated, they'll give you a short introduction first, and you can address them by name, and help them with their troubles. The AI model has access to your previous chatlogs and will address your tips, but will also contionously ask questions to keep you on your toes. There's always the option to clear the chat and create a new person if you want to restart anew.

- Feedback
  -   Anyone knows that with learning comes growth. If we want to expand on our capabilities, then we need to get feedback. By using the feedback button, users can get directed to a page where their previous conversation gets compiled into comprehensive feedback for the user to use later. If they like the feedback, then they are free to download it as a .txt file and return to chat to start anew.
